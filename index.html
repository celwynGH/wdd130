        <p>Hello! My name is Celwyn Alexis Panis, and I am from Camiguin Island, Philippines.
            I am 40 years old, born on August 7, 1984. I am happily married to my wife,
            Ether Guiang Panis, and together we are raising our two children —
            Peniel Alexis G. Panis and Phil Jethro G. Panis. With another blessing on the way,
            as my wife is currently six months pregnant, I am joyfully preparing to welcome a
            new addition to our growing family. I am a devoted husband and hands-on father.
            I cherish quality time with my children — whether at home or engaging in outdoor
            activities like spearfishing — and I find joy and fulfillment in being present
            for my family.
