        <p>Hello! My name is Celwyn Alexis Panis, and I am from Camiguin Island, Philippines.
            I am 40 years old, born on August 7, 1984. I am happily married to my wife,
            Ether Guiang Panis, and together we are raising our two children ‚Äî
            Peniel Alexis G. Panis and Phil Jethro G. Panis. With another blessing on the way,
            as my wife is currently six months pregnant, I am joyfully preparing to welcome a
            new addition to our growing family. I am a devoted husband and hands-on father.
            I cherish quality time with my children ‚Äî whether at home or engaging in outdoor
            activities like spearfishing ‚Äî and I find joy and fulfillment in being present
            for my family.
