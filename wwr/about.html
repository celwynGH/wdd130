            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>

Splash White Water Rafting was founded in 2025 with one simple goal: to share the excitement and beauty of river adventures with everyone. What began as a small group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts has grown into a trusted name in white water rafting adventures.

Starting with just a few rafts and a dream, we began offering guided trips on the Cagayan de Oro river, known for its thrilling rapids and scenic beauty. Our commitment to safety, customer satisfaction, and fun quickly earned us a loyal following.

Over the years, we have expanded our services to include group tours, team-building activities, and customized river adventures for families, schools, and corporate clients. With a team of certified guides and a strong focus on eco-tourism and conservation, Splash White Water Rafting continues to provide unforgettable experiences in nature.

Today, we are proud to be one of the leading rafting companies in the region, offering not just rides, but memories that last a lifetime.</p>
